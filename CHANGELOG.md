## 4.0.0 — Siege Core and extended preparation

- Require a player-placed core in the faction's native Recruits Overworld claim for new sieges; beds no longer set targets. Existing active raids retain their saved target.
- Add a free first-login core, recovery recipe, occupation objective and protected placement during active sieges.
- Add three shared hire offers per faction: 80% recruit, 10% shieldman, 10% archer per slot, rotating every 15 server-runtime minutes. Use native prices, currency, hiring events and unit limits.
- Persist stock independently of core placement so replacements and server restarts do not reroll or restock it.
- Add a configurable 12-minute establishment, fortification and army muster period. Use a separate supplied Workers blueprint for the palisade; hold the first assault wave at camp before release.
- Include the builder visibility, supplied native siege operators and all-four-required dependency changes below.
- Fix siege operator retry timing for server ticks that do not align with multiples of 100.

# Changelog

All notable changes to Faction Raids are documented here.

## 3.7.0 - 2026-09-08

- Require Recruits, Workers 2, Small Ships and Siege Weapons in Forge metadata and CurseForge release relations.
- Keep builders at camp after construction finishes; retain the crew if native setup falls back to scripted building.
- Expand safe camp searches and announce camp coordinates, crew/equipment counts, or the absence of a safe site.
- Deploy ranged engines outside the palisade in collision-checked slots. Legacy unmanned ram/tower choices use ballistas with native operators.
- Initialize hostile siege operators, provide ammunition and food, mount native controllers after the warning period, and avoid replacing killed operators.
- Preserve unloaded engine cleanup identities and prevent raider catapult shots from causing untracked terrain explosions.

## 3.6.1 - 2026-09-07

- Clear stale formation markers for vanilla auxiliary enemies after reload, so their direct movement is never suppressed by an unavailable Recruits formation API.
- Includes the supplied native Workers camp construction and movement fixes from 3.6.0.

## 3.6.0 - 2026-09-07

- Workers 2 enemy builders receive native build areas, private supply storage stocked once from the blueprint's actual material list, tools, and food. Construction pauses at night without using its timeout budget.
- Native camp work records the full restoration footprint before construction. Interrupted jobs cannot mine player replacements; areas and crew are retired together. Ownership, supplies and pending jobs survive saves without replenishing stock.
- Formation marching no longer competes with direct objective navigation. Soldiers leave formation to fight or capture, and boat passengers are excluded from walking orders.
- Straggler recovery retries walking instead of teleporting to the army centroid. Sideways movement around obstacles counts as progress; only prolonged stationary stalls are retired.
- Reviewed the supplied 3.5.2 session log: normal exit, no crash exception. Config default-generation warnings do not indicate a failed launch.

## 3.5.2 - 2026-09-07

- Raider boats detect twenty seconds of actual stalled approach progress, including boats wedged in water. Fixed the old timer running once per second as if it were once per tick.
- Landing checks account for ship width, nested Small Ships seats, dry solid ground, collision space, world borders and loaded chunks. Spread landed raiders across safe positions; keep them aboard if no safe nearby landing exists.
- Disembarked Recruits have native mounting orders cleared and ground navigation directed toward the active siege objective. Players and unrelated passengers are not ejected.
- Persist convoy team/beach tags on vessels and rebuild tracking from loaded raiders after restart or chunk reload. Recover older untagged boats without assuming ownership or deleting them afterward.

## 3.5.1 - 2026-09-07

- Enemy effort bonuses now accelerate breach/occupation only while attackers outnumber defenders inside the active objective. Clearing or matching their presence correctly reverses pressure, even with queued bonuses.
- Show live objective attacker/defender counts and Capturing/Recovering/Held/Secure status in the boss bar, periodic action bar and Codex overview.
- Banner sabotage now removes the current wave without granting kill credit. Retreated IDs persist across saves so unloaded raiders cannot return or be counted again by reconciliation. Reconciling also excludes pre-raid scouts.
- Opening reconnaissance reports name the marked defensive point and explain how to hold it. Camp sabotage guidance explains the campfire, banner and supply-barrel effects; messages clarify that later waves still attack.
- Canceled block-break events no longer activate camp sabotage. Camp handling runs after normal protection handlers.

## 3.5.0 - 2026-09-07

- War camps gently level soil across their interior, with cuts and fills capped at three blocks and a three-block transition into surrounding terrain. Adjacent surface columns must remain within one block of height so camp exits do not end at a cliff.
- Validate the entire site before earthworks. Reject water, non-soil foundations, containers, obstructed building space, excluded claims, unloaded chunks and excessive excavation. Try another site when unsuitable.
- Snapshot every cut and fill in the existing saved camp ledger. Restore ground before vegetation during cleanup; natural dirt/grass changes remain restorable, while different player replacement blocks are preserved.
- New `levelCampTerrain` setting defaults to true. Leveling is disabled when camp cleanup is disabled. Existing camps are not retroactively leveled.

## 3.4.0 - 2026-09-07

- Villager Workers 2 builders now assemble the actual war camp's towers, forge and tents a few blocks at a time. Builders walk to nearby work positions and swing while building; missing, dead or fleeing workers cannot build remotely.
- Camp workers belong to the Raiders faction, not the defending player. They stay out of player job areas and storage routines and do not count toward assault waves.
- Camp construction jobs, elapsed time and worker IDs now survive server restarts. Unloaded crew are cleaned up when they return after a siege ends.
- Every construction placement uses the siege's existing block snapshot and restoration system. Occupied blocks and spaces containing living entities are skipped.
- Removed the broken parallel blueprint/lumber-area spawn path. Native tree cutting is disabled because it bypassed terrain restoration; the old lumberjack cap remains readable for config compatibility.
- Camps still construct automatically without Workers or with compatibility disabled. Stalled decoration jobs expire without delaying assault waves. Fixed the old seconds-versus-ticks construction delay by replacing it with a bounded per-pass block budget.
- Updated Workers 2 ownership calls and reject incompatible NPC initialization before registration.

## 3.3.2 - 2026-09-07

- Prevent a failed enemy spawn initializer from crashing the server tick. In particular,
  Recruits 1.15.2 siege engineers can cast their custom navigator to an incompatible
  vanilla class. Discard failed mobs before registration and initialize a fresh pillager
  at the same position, preserving wave progress without retaining partial entities.
- Fix ballista controller attachment using the shared Recruits siege-controller API.
- Snapshot a sapper's entire breach before changing any blocks. Preserve both halves of
  doors, including doors at the blast boundary, and respect the restoration cap atomically.
- Preserve the first terrain snapshot when a temporary camp block is placed repeatedly;
  restore the terrain beneath camp blocks that defenders already destroyed.
- Apply camp-construction timeouts in game ticks instead of counting each one-second
  lifecycle pass as a single tick (previously a 180-second limit lasted about an hour).
- Check the siege dimension before applying camp sabotage effects, and process breaks
  after protection handlers have had an opportunity to cancel them.
- Discard raiders that remain stuck after rescue so entity reconciliation cannot add
  them back into the wave. Count them as escaped and clear their tracking records.
  Keep raiders holding the current breach/capture objective, fighting visible defenders,
  or riding vehicles out of straggler rescue.
- Add regression coverage for spawn failure isolation, door snapshots, camp timeouts,
  repeated camp placements, and straggler retirement; run the checks in the Java 17 build.

## Unreleased — Refactor: Scalability Foundation

No gameplay changes. Pure internal refactor to make future features easier and safer to add.

- Added `ModConstants` for tick math, NBT tag keys, boss-bar defaults and the shared chat prefix.
- Added `FactionLogger` (single SLF4J logger) and routed swallowed command failures through it.

- Added `command/RaidCommands` and moved the entire `/factionraids` Brigadier tree out of `RaidEvents`.
- Added `command/PlayerCommand.run(...)` to remove the repeated player-resolution try/catch that
  appeared 16 times in `RaidEvents`.

  supplies, banners and a forward palisade.

## 2.6.0 - 2026-09-04

- Protected Villager Workers from illagers spawned by Faction Raids while preserving native work,
  take-cover and flee AI.
